    "\n",
    "## 🔗 Prerequisites & Progress\n",
    "**You've Built**: Complete transformer architecture (Module 13) and profiling tools (Module 14)\n",
    "**You'll Build**: Memoization system that eliminates redundant computation through caching\n",

    "3. Implement KVCache with efficient memory management and O(1) updates\n",
    "4. Build cache-aware attention that reuses previously computed keys and values\n",
    "5. Measure dramatic speedup gains (10-15x) and understand memory trade-offs\n",

    "## 🎯 Part 5: Using KV Cache in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Integration Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "To use KV caching in your transformer generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before Generation:**\n",
    "1. Create cache with `enable_kv_cache()`\n",
    "2. Set cache dimensions to match your model architecture\n",
    "3. Verify memory usage is acceptable\n",
    "\n",
    "**During Generation (Modified Forward Pass):**\n",
    "1. For the first token (prompt), process normally and populate cache\n",
    "2. For subsequent tokens:\n",
    "   - Only process the NEW token (not entire sequence)\n",
    "   - Update cache with new K,V pairs\n",
    "   - Retrieve full cached K,V for attention\n",
    "   - Use cached values in attention computation\n",
    "   - Advance cache position after all layers\n",
    "\n",
    "**After Generation:**\n",
    "1. Reset cache if generating another sequence\n",
    "2. Monitor memory usage for production deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Expected Speedup by Sequence Length:\n",
    "┌───────────┬──────────┬───────────┬──────────┐\n",
    "│ Seq Len   │ No Cache │ With Cache│ Speedup  │\n",
    "├───────────┼──────────┼───────────┼──────────┤\n",
    "│  10 tokens│ ~80 tok/s│ ~600 tok/s│   7.5x   │\n",
    "│  25 tokens│ ~40 tok/s│ ~500 tok/s│  12.5x   │\n",
    "│  50 tokens│ ~25 tok/s│ ~400 tok/s│  16.0x   │\n",
    "│ 100 tokens│ ~12 tok/s│ ~200 tok/s│  16.7x   │\n",
    "└───────────┴──────────┴───────────┴──────────┘\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: Speedup increases with sequence length!\n",
    "Why? Longer sequences = more redundant computation without cache.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Management:**\n",
    "- Cache memory = `batch_size × num_layers × num_heads × max_seq_len × head_dim × 4 bytes`\n",
    "- For GPT-2 (12 layers, 12 heads, seq_len=1024, head_dim=64): ~37 MB per sequence\n",
    "- For GPT-3 (96 layers, 96 heads, seq_len=2048, head_dim=128): ~4.7 GB per sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-off Analysis:**\n",
    "- **10x+ speedup** for typical generation lengths (50-200 tokens)\n",
    "- **Modest memory cost** compared to model parameters (often <1% of model size)\n",
    "- **Enables real-time interaction** that's impossible without caching\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "1. Always use caching for production serving\n",
    "2. Tune `max_seq_len` to expected generation length (don't over-allocate)\n",
    "3. Consider batch inference to amortize model loading costs\n",
    "4. Monitor cache memory usage in production"

    "## 🎯 Part 5: Non-Invasive Integration with Existing Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "We built KV caching in Module 17 (this module), but our transformer (Modules 12-13) doesn't know about it!\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ BAD Solution**: Go back and modify Module 12 (MultiHeadAttention)\n",
    "- Breaks \"forward-only\" learning (students shouldn't revisit old modules)\n",
    "- Makes Module 12 depend on Module 17 (wrong dependency direction!)\n",
    "- Violates clean module boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ GOOD Solution**: Module 17 ADDS caching to existing models without modification!\n",
    "- Use composition + monkey-patching (like `enable_autograd()`)\n",
    "- Module 17 wraps/enhances Module 12, not modifies it\n",
    "- Students learn systems engineering: \"Add capabilities, don't break old code\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create `enable_kv_cache(model)` that:\n",
    "1. Creates cache for the model's architecture\n",
    "2. Wraps each attention layer with caching logic\n",
    "3. Intercepts attention calls and manages cache automatically\n",
    "4. Returns the cache for manual control if needed\n",
    "\n",

    "    TODO: Create cache and non-invasively patch attention layers\n",

    "    APPROACH:\n",
    "    1. Validate model has required attributes (embed_dim, num_layers, num_heads, max_seq_len, blocks)\n",
    "    2. Calculate head_dim from embed_dim and num_heads\n",
    "    3. Create KVCache instance sized for this model's architecture\n",

    "    5. For each transformer block, wrap its attention forward method with caching logic\n",
    "    6. Print confirmation message with cache statistics\n",

    "    >>> model._cache_enabled  # True\n",
    "    >>> cache.num_layers  # 4 (matches model)\n",
    "\n",

    "    - Use hasattr() to validate model attributes exist\n",
    "    - head_dim = model.embed_dim // model.num_heads\n",
    "    - Store cache on model with model._kv_cache = cache\n",
    "    - Set flag with model._cache_enabled = True\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer these questions based on your implementation and the concepts you've learned in Modules 01-17.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1: Cache Size Calculation\n",
    "A 12-layer transformer has 12 attention heads per layer, 64-dimensional embeddings per head,\n",
    "maximum sequence length of 2048, and batch size of 8. Calculate the KV cache size:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step calculation**:\n",
    "- One cache tensor shape: (batch=8, heads=12, seq_len=2048, head_dim=64)\n",
    "- Elements per tensor: 8 × 12 × 2048 × 64 = _________\n",
    "- Each layer has K cache + V cache = _________ tensors per layer\n",
    "- Total across 12 layers = _________ cache tensors\n",
    "- Float32 = 4 bytes per element\n",
    "- Total memory in MB: _________\n",
    "\n",
    "**Follow-up**: If this model has 125M parameters (500 MB), what percentage of model memory\n",
    "is the cache? Is this overhead acceptable?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: Speed vs Memory Trade-off\n",
    "Your KVCache makes generation 10× faster but uses several GB of RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a production API serving 1000 users simultaneously:\n",
    "- Without cache: Each generation is slow (10 sec) but uses minimal memory\n",
    "- With cache: Each generation is fast (1 sec) but uses 100 MB cache per user = 100 GB total!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions**:\n",
    "- For an interactive chatbot, is this trade-off worth it? Why?\n",
    "- What happens if your server only has 64 GB RAM but needs to serve 1000 users?\n",
    "- How would you design a system that balances speed and memory for many concurrent users?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Batch Inference Scaling\n",
    "With KV cache, each sequence in a batch gets its own cache storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**: Batch size 1 generates at 500 tokens/sec, using 50 MB cache.\n",
    "- For batch size 8: Predicted cache memory = _________ MB (scales how?)\n",
    "- Does each sequence still generate at 500 tokens/sec? Why or why not?\n",
    "- What's the throughput difference: 1×500 tok/s vs 8×? tok/s = _________ total tok/s\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-off question**: For a production API, when should you use:\n",
    "- High batch size (8-16): Good for _________\n",
    "- Low batch size (1-2): Good for _________\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Cache Eviction for Long Conversations\n",
    "Your `KVCache` has `max_seq_len=2048`. A chatbot conversation reaches 2048 tokens - the cache is full!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options when cache is full**:\n",

    "2. **FIFO eviction**: Drop oldest tokens, keep recent 2048\n",
    "3. **Sliding window**: Keep most recent N tokens\n",
    "4. **Restart cache**: Clear everything and start over\n",
    "\n",

    "### Question 5: Production Reality - Multi-User Serving\n",
    "ChatGPT serves millions of users. Each user's conversation needs its own KV cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory calculation for 10,000 concurrent conversations**:\n",
    "- Each cache: 200 MB (typical for GPT-3.5 scale model)\n",

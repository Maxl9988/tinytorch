    "# 1. Introduction - What is Fair Benchmarking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarking in ML systems isn't just timing code - it's about making fair, reproducible comparisons that guide real optimization decisions. Think of it like standardized testing: everyone takes the same test under the same conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider comparing three models: a base CNN, a quantized version, and a pruned version. Without proper benchmarking, you might conclude the quantized model is \"fastest\" because you measured it when your CPU was idle, while testing the others during peak system load. Fair benchmarking controls for these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge: ML models have multiple competing objectives (accuracy vs speed vs memory), measurements can be noisy, and \"faster\" depends on your hardware and use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benchmarking as a Systems Engineering Discipline\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional ML benchmarking requires understanding measurement uncertainty and controlling for confounding factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Foundations**: We need enough measurements to achieve statistical significance. Running a model once tells you nothing about its true performance - you need distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Noise Sources**:\n",
    "- **Thermal throttling**: CPU frequency drops when hot\n",
    "- **Background processes**: OS interrupts and other applications\n",
    "- **Memory pressure**: Garbage collection, cache misses\n",
    "- **Network interference**: For distributed models\n",

    "- Same hardware configuration\n",
    "- Same input data distributions\n",
    "- Same measurement methodology\n",
    "- Statistical significance testing\n",

    "## Central Limit Theorem in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a model many times, the distribution of measurements approaches normal (regardless of the underlying noise distribution). This lets us:\n",

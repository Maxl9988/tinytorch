    "\n",
    "Training is where the magic happens - it's the process that transforms a randomly initialized neural network into an intelligent system that can solve problems. Think of training as teaching: you show the model examples, it makes predictions, you measure how wrong it is, and then you adjust its parameters to do better next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process follows a consistent pattern across all machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward Pass**: Input flows through the model to produce predictions\n",
    "2. **Loss Calculation**: Compare predictions to true answers\n",
    "3. **Backward Pass**: Compute gradients showing how to improve\n",
    "4. **Parameter Update**: Adjust model weights using an optimizer\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Continue until the model learns the pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "But production training systems need much more than this basic loop. They need learning rate scheduling (starting fast, slowing down), gradient clipping (preventing exploding gradients), checkpointing (saving progress), and evaluation modes (testing without learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we're building today:**\n",
    "- A complete `Trainer` class that orchestrates the entire learning process\n",
    "- Learning rate scheduling that adapts during training\n",

    "## 🤔 Part 6: ML Systems Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we complete this module, let's reflect on the systems aspects of training infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use only knowledge from Modules 01-07 to answer these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Memory Trade-offs:**\n",
    "   - If you have a model with 1 million parameters and use Adam optimizer, estimate the total training memory required (parameters + gradients + optimizer state).\n",
    "   - How does gradient accumulation help when you want batch_size=128 but can only fit batch_size=32 in memory?\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Gradient Clipping:**\n",
    "   - Why do we clip gradients by *global norm* rather than clipping each gradient independently?\n",
    "   - What happens to training if gradients consistently exceed max_norm? What does this signal?\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Learning Rate Scheduling:**\n",
    "   - Why does cosine annealing start with high learning rate and end with low learning rate?\n",
    "   - Compare training with fixed lr=0.1 vs cosine schedule (0.1 → 0.01). When might fixed LR be better?\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Checkpointing Strategy:**\n",
    "   - You're training for 100 epochs. Checkpoints are large (1GB each). How often should you save checkpoints?\n",
    "   - What information MUST be in a checkpoint to resume training exactly where you left off?\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Train vs Eval Modes:**\n",
    "   - Why is it crucial to set model.training = False during evaluation?\n",
    "   - What would happen if you forgot to zero gradients between training steps?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about these questions. The answers reveal deep understanding of training systems!**"

    "## Part 1: Introduction - What is Attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention is the mechanism that allows models to focus on relevant parts of the input when processing sequences. Think of it as a search engine inside your neural network - given a query, attention finds the most relevant keys and retrieves their associated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Attention Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read \"The cat sat on the ___\", your brain automatically focuses on \"cat\" and \"sat\" to predict \"mat\". This selective focus is exactly what attention mechanisms provide to neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine attention as a library research system:\n",
    "- **Query (Q)**: \"I need information about machine learning\"\n",
    "- **Keys (K)**: Index cards describing each book's content\n",
    "- **Values (V)**: The actual books on the shelves\n",
    "- **Attention Process**: Find books whose descriptions match your query, then retrieve those books\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Attention Changed Everything\n",
    "\n",
    "Before attention, RNNs processed sequences step-by-step, creating an information bottleneck:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "RNN Processing (Sequential):\n",
    "Token 1 → Hidden → Token 2 → Hidden → ... → Final Hidden\n",
    "         ↓              ↓                      ↓\n",
    "    Limited Info   Compressed State    All Information Lost\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention allows direct connections between any two positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attention Processing (Parallel):\n",
    "Token 1 ←─────────→ Token 2 ←─────────→ Token 3 ←─────────→ Token 4\n",
    "   ↑                   ↑                   ↑                   ↑\n",
    "   └─────────────── Direct Connections ──────────────────────┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables:\n",
    "- **Long-range dependencies**: Connecting words far apart\n",
    "- **Parallel computation**: No sequential dependencies\n",
    "- **Interpretable focus patterns**: We can see what the model attends to\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention computes a weighted sum of values, where weights are determined by the similarity between queries and keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) V\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple formula powers GPT, BERT, and virtually every modern language model."

    "## 🤔 ML Systems Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions help you connect your implementation to production ML systems and real-world trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1: Quadratic Complexity\n",
    "For sequence length 1024, how much memory does attention's O(n²) use? What about length 2048?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: You implemented attention with explicit nested loops showing the quadratic scaling. For float32 (4 bytes per value), the attention matrix for seq_len=n requires n² × 4 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about**:\n",
    "- Memory for seq_len=1024: 1024² × 4 bytes = _____ MB\n",
    "- Memory for seq_len=2048: 2048² × 4 bytes = _____ MB\n",
    "- Scaling factor when doubling sequence length: _____×\n",
    "- Why this limits transformer context lengths in production\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: Attention Bottleneck\n",
    "In production transformers, attention is often the memory bottleneck, not the FFN (feed-forward network). Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: A typical transformer has attention + FFN layers. FFN parameters scale as O(n × d²) where d is embed_dim, while attention activations scale as O(n²).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about**:\n",
    "- For short sequences (n << d): Which dominates, attention or FFN? _____\n",
    "- For long sequences (n >> d): Which dominates? _____\n",
    "- At what sequence length does attention become the bottleneck?\n",
    "- Why does this matter for models like GPT-3 (96 layers, 2048 context)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Multi-Head Trade-off\n",
    "8 attention heads vs 1 head with 8× dimensions - same parameters, different performance. What's the systems difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: Your MultiHeadAttention splits embed_dim=512 into 8 heads of 64 dims each. Alternative: one head with full 512 dims.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about**:\n",
    "- Parameter count: 8 heads × 64 dims vs 1 head × 512 dims = _____ (same or different?)\n",
    "- Memory access patterns: Multiple small heads vs one large head\n",
    "- Parallelization: Can heads run in parallel? _____\n",
    "- Specialization: Why might diverse small heads learn better than one large head?\n",
    "- Cache efficiency: Smaller head_dim vs larger single dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Masking Cost\n",
    "Causal masking (for autoregressive models) zeros out half the attention matrix. Do we save computation or just correctness?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: You set masked positions to -∞ before softmax. In a seq_len=n causal mask, roughly n²/2 positions are masked (upper triangle).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about**:\n",
    "- Does your implementation skip computation for masked positions? _____\n",
    "- Does setting scores to -1e9 before softmax save compute? _____\n",
    "- What would you need to change to actually skip masked computation?\n",
    "- In production, does sparse attention (skipping masked positions) help? _____\n",
    "- Memory saved: Can we avoid storing masked attention weights?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: Flash Attention\n",
    "Modern systems use \"flash attention\" to reduce attention's memory from O(n²) to O(n). How might this work conceptually?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: Your implementation computes full attention matrix (batch, seq_len, seq_len), then applies it to values. FlashAttention reformulates this to never materialize the full matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about**:\n",
    "- Your implementation: stores (seq_len × seq_len) attention weights\n",
    "- FlashAttention idea: Compute attention in _____? (blocks, tiles, chunks)\n",
    "- Recomputation trade-off: Save memory by _____ during backward pass\n",
    "- Why does this enable longer context windows?\n",
    "- Is this an algorithm change or just implementation optimization?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6: Gradient Memory (Bonus)\n",
    "Training requires storing activations for backward pass. How much extra memory does backprop through attention need?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: Your forward pass creates attention matrices. Backward pass needs these for gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about**:\n",
    "- Forward memory: attention matrix = n² values\n",
    "- Backward memory: gradients also n² values\n",
    "- Total training memory: forward + backward = _____ × inference memory\n",
    "- With Adam optimizer (stores momentum + velocity): _____ × inference memory\n",
    "- For GPT-3 scale (96 layers, 2048 context): _____ GB just for attention gradients"
